    <p class="text mt-2">
      With this app you can create Model's for Magento 2 very fast. If you are not sure what a Model in Magento 2 is,
      i can recommend you to read <a class="underline" href="https://www.michiel-gerritsen.com/where-to-place-code-in-a-magento-2-module" target="_blank">this article</a>
      (tldr: It's everything that you to need to connect to your database).

    <p class="text mt-4">
      Writing models can become cumberstone and dready, as you need to write a whole bunch of boilerplate code which is sort of the same for every model you need to make.
    </p>

    <p class="text mt-4">
      This app tries to take the cumberstone out of your hands and generate the code for you.

    <h3 class="heading">Is this the same as <a href="https://mage2gen.com/" target="_blank">Mage2gen</a>?</h3>

    <p class="text mt-2">
      I've used Mage2gen many times myself and it does a great job, but when it comes to creating models i still had to do too much manual work to get everything right.
    </p>

    <p class="text mt-2">
      This app only focusses on creating the Model's and the admingrid's and do that thing good.
