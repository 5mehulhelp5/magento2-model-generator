    <p class="text mt-2">
      With this app, you can create models for Magento 2 very fast. If you are
      not sure what a model in Magento 2 is, I can recommend you to read
      <a
        class="underline"
        href="https://www.michiel-gerritsen.com/where-to-place-code-in-a-magento-2-module"

      (TLDR: It's everything that you need to connect to your database).
    </p>

    <p class="text mt-4">
      Writing models can become cumbersome, as you need to write a whole bunch
      of boilerplate code which is sort of the same for every model you need to
      make.
    </p>

    <p class="text mt-4">
      This app tries to take the cumbersome out of your hands and generate the
      code for you.

      Is this the same as
      <a href="https://mage2gen.com/" target="_blank">Mage2gen</a>?
    </h3>

    <p class="text mt-2">
      I've used Mage2gen many times myself and it does a great job, but when it
      comes to creating models I still had to do too much manual work to get
      everything right.
    </p>

    <p class="text mt-4">
      This app only focuses on creating the models and the admingrids and does
      that thing well.
